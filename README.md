# Weighted Boxes Fusion Hypertuned Explainable YOLOv8

This repository presents the combination of methods for obtaining an optimized you only look once (YOLO) model.

---

> To perform the hypetuning of the **Optuna framework** is applied.

> For architecture optimization the **weighted box fusion (WBF)** is used.

> For interpretability the **xxx** explainable AI (XAI) is presented.

The model presented in this repository was evaluated using the dataset realeased by Dexter Lewis and Pratik Kulkarni, which can be found at [competition-insulator-defect-detection](https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/vkdw-x769) (accessed on March 25, 2023).

**We encourage you to perform comparative analyzes with your dataset!**
