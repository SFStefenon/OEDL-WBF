# Weighted Boxes Fusion Hypertuned Explainable YOLOv8

This repository presents the combination of methods for obtaining an optimized you only look once (YOLO) model.

---

### To perform the hypetuning of the **Optuna framework** is applied.

There are two ways to compute the Optuna, the first is locally on a cluster or your PC and the second is using Google Colab.


> **B)** For architecture optimization the **weighted box fusion (WBF)** is used.

> **C)** For interpretability the **xxx** explainable AI (XAI) is presented.

**A)** 

Please go ahead and try it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SFStefenon/EWT-Seq2Seq-LSTM-Attention/blob/main/EWT-Seq2Seq-LSTM-Attention.ipynb)!

The model presented in this repository was evaluated using the dataset realeased by Dexter Lewis and Pratik Kulkarni, which can be found at [competition-insulator-defect-detection](https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/vkdw-x769) (accessed on March 25, 2023).

**We encourage you to perform comparative analyzes with your dataset!**
