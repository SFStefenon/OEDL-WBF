## For architecture optimization the **weighted box fusion (WBF)** is used.

To apply the WBF you will need to train the model several times and save the weights. After that the WFB ensemble the YOLOs to have a better prediction. You can find the algorithm [here](https://github.com/SFStefenon/WBF-HE-YOLO/blob/main/Weighted_Box_Fusion/WBF_yolo.ipynb).
